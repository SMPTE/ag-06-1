    <p>This Administrative Guideline provides instructions for completing a <dfn>New Project Form</dfn>, which is available at <a href="#element-a"></a>, in <a href="#sec-elements"></a>.</p>
    <p class="note"><a>New Project Forms</a>, once approved, will be added to the collection of other approved AG forms posted to a location specified by the SMPTE Director of Standards Development.</p>
    <p class="note">No projects may be created without filling in a copy of a <a>New Project Form</a>. This document is intended to help collect information so that a Technology Committee Chair may start the New Project Process detailed in the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a></p>

    <section id="sec-title-table-1">
      <h3>Title (Table 1)</h3>
      <p>The title of your project should be short and descriptive title starting with the TC parent group. This appears on all project lists.</p>
      <p class="note">As soon as you have chosen your title, replace the text “AG-06 New Project Form” with that title and save this file with a filename of the form:</p>
<pre>

      <dl>
        <dt>&lt;TC&gt;</dt>
        <dd>is the Group that authored the document e.g. <b>31FS</b></dd>
        <dt>&lt;type&gt;</dt>
        <dd>is the output document type <b>ST | RP | EG | RDD | AN | ER | OV | AG</b></dd>

        <dt>&lt;update&gt;</dt>
        <dd>is the word <b>Revision</b> or <b>Amendment</b> or is absent</dd>
        <dt>&lt;description&gt;</dt>
        <dd>is a brief indicator of subject, such as an abbreviated name of the project, constructed using only alpha characters, digits, space (“ “) and "-"•</dd>
        <dt>&lt;note&gt;</dt>
        <dd>is an optional string that can be used to annotate the project, e.g. <b>coordination</b>. The &lt;note&gt; shall be constructed using only alpha characters, digits, “-“</dd>

      <ul>
        <li>Required but unknown fields should be replaced with <code>XX</code> until known</li>

      <h3>Proponents (Table 2)</h3>
      <p>The <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a> §6.3 requires <em>one or more Proponents, who are SMPTE Standards Members agreeing to be actively involved in the Project</em>. Proponents are individuals and not organizations. The first listed proponent will become the publicly visible main contact for the project. The proponent’s field is not publicly visible but can be seen by Standards Community members. Please extend the table as needed.</p>

        <h4>Notes for Table 3</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Chair</dt>
          <dd>Just the name of the person who will be the main contact for the project. No email address – it will be on a public website. Usually the first listed proponent.</dd>
          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dd>A short description of the project’s purpose and objectives. This text is aimed at the public who will read it and thus should be able to understand the Project in general terms. There may be extra requirements for this field for the Public CD Process (<a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a>)</dd>
          <dt>Problem to be solved</dt>
          <dd>A short statement about the problem to be solved. Ideally phrased in terms of requirements such that when those requirements are met, the document is complete. There may be extra requirements for this field for the Public CD Process (<a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a>)</dd>
          <dt>Project scope</dt>
          <dd>A short description of the scope of work that will be done and optionally elements that are out of scope. A narrow scope often results in a faster, more controlled project lifecycle. An example would be <em>“Revision of standard ST xxx to roll-up amendment ST-xxx-Amd-1 and to update the normative references”</em>. This limited scope is intended to restrict the work to just the details in the scope without opening the document up for redesign.</dd>
          <dt>Specific Tasks</dt>
          <dd>A high-level list of tasks that need to be completed as the work progresses. Consider test materials, sample bitstreams, sample software, data schemas, validation criteria, problem decomposition, liaisons with other organizations etc.</dd>
          <dt>Type of Output</dt>
          <dd>Check one or more boxes where:
<pre>
ST – Standard               RP  – Recommended Practice             Rev –Revision
EG – Engineering Guideline  AMD – Amendment

          <dt>Public CD</dt>
          <dd>Please indicate if you intend to use the <a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a> process. This decision can be changed at any time.</dd>
          <dt>Editor</dt>
          <dd>Member of the Standards Community who will edit the document.</dd>
          <dt>Dates</dt>
          <dd>Estimation of the start and end dates of the project. Consult with TC Chair or SVP or Engineering Director for help.</dd>
          <dt>Known References</dt>
          <dd>Complete this section if there are known documents or bodies of work critical to the project e.g. SMPTE mapping of an ITU or ISO/IEC standard.</dd>
          <dt>External Liaisons</dt>
          <dd>Known entities to be informed that the project has started. The Group should draft the liaison letter for the SVP and submit via the TC chairs.</dd>

If the Group already exists, enter its name exactly as shown in Teams. If a new Group is required, enter the proposed name and fill out the fields below for the new group to be set up.

<pre>
WG – Working Group typically for larger projects with several subgroups doing drafting
DG – Drafting Group for drafting an individual document
SG – Study Group to create an Engineering Report (internal to SMPTE or for publication)
TF – Task Force for study groups involving multiple TCs or active participation by 
     external organizations
